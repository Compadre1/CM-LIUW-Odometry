## Project Description

The **CM-LIUW-Odometry** project addresses the unique challenges posed by coal mine tunnels, where GPS signals are often unavailable and conditions can be harsh. By combining data from multiple sensors, we enhance the accuracy and reliability of odometry measurements. This project utilizes advanced algorithms to process data from LiDAR and IMUs, improving navigation in environments with significant obstacles and degradation.

### Problem Statement

Navigating in coal mine tunnels poses several challenges:

- **Limited Visibility**: Traditional GPS systems fail in underground environments.
- **Variable Terrain**: The ground conditions can change rapidly, affecting odometry.
- **Interference**: Signals from various sources can interfere with sensor readings.

The **CM-LIUW-Odometry** system aims to mitigate these issues through sensor fusion techniques, ensuring reliable and precise navigation.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Sensor Fusion**: Combines data from LiDAR, IMUs, UWB, and wheel odometry.
- **Robustness**: Maintains accuracy in extreme conditions typical of coal mine tunnels.
- **High Precision**: Achieves centimeter-level accuracy in odometry measurements.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Processes sensor data in real-time for immediate feedback.
- **Open Source**: Available for modification and improvement by the community.
